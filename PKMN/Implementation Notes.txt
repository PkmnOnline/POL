Pretty much every Pokemon and character appear to have textured eyes which are switched between by changing the UV offsets. Quite a few also have their pupils on a seperate mesh placed over the face with alpha masking. Depending on the Pokemon if they have a suitably placed jaw it's rigged into the skeleton otherwise they also use textures for the mouth.
