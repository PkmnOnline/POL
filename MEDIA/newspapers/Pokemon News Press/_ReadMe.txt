	- Dusk Ball "Dark caves and streets unlit at night are forbidding places to go. If you're threatened by the dark, a supply of Dusk Balls is your biggest ally! Use them in the dark for the best Pokémon-catching performance! Keep the dark at bay on your travels with Dusk Balls!"
	- Heal Ball "Catching Pokémon is best accomplished by whittling the target's HP down as low as possible, then tossing a Ball. But a Pokémon caught that way can't be used in battle right away. That's where the Heal Ball comes in handy. You can lower the target's HP bar to red, put it to sleep, or paralyze it. The Heal Ball instantly heals whatever ails the Pokémon it catches! That's the Pokémon-friendly Heal Ball! Please, do give it a try!"
	- Quick Ball "When attempting to catch a Pokémon, you want to cut the target's HP. But a fleet-footed Pokémon could bolt if you take too much time. The Quick Ball is the solution to that dilemma. It's designed to work best when thrown right at the start of battle! The Quick Ball: the perfect gift for the impatient Trainer!"
