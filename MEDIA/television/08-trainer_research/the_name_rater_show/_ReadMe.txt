The Name Rater Show
	A program that tells a Pokémon's fortune from its nickname. This program updates whenever a player gives a Pokémon a new nickname. The fortunes depend on the first letter of the Pokémon's nickname.

	"The time has come for the latest episode of The Name Rater Show! Using the nickname bestowed on a Pokémon, I will tell its fortune! Today's guest is <name> with a/an <Pokémon> named <nickname>! Now let me see... Mm-hmm... Oh, yes. Hmm... This Pokémon's nickname tells me..."
	1, 8, F, M, T, b, i, p, w, <sad face>, <diamond>, <music note>, #, *, ?, ~	"That this Pokémon has a great penchant for battle! Indeed! Even when you think it might lose, this Pokémon won't give up! It'll strike fear into opponents with a vibe that says, "You're gonna miss!""
	2, 9, G, N, U, c, j, q, x, <sun>, <angry face>, <star>, +, <ellipsis>, <bullet> "That this Pokémon will be very spoiled by its Trainer! What a life! It always wants <name> to fuss over it and care for it. And yet I also get the feeling that... Yes, the sounds of <nickname> tell me that you should definitely give this Pokémon a lot of love in Pokémon-Amie!"
	3, A, H, O, V, d, k, r, y, <ring>, <cloud>, <up arrow>, é, <male symbol>, %, :, <comma>, <left quote> "That this Pokémon has quite a bit of happiness waiting for it! If it uses Thunder in battle, it'll succeed about 70 percent of the time! Yes... That's right. It's quite average, isn't it? <Nickname> is a pretty average nickname, after all. What it boils down to is that being average is no bad thing!"
	4, B, I, P, W, e, l, s, z, <circle>, <umbrella>, <down arrow>, <female symbol>, -, ;, <right quote> "That it is one thoughtful Pokémon! That's what kind of name it has. If you put this one in a contest, I don't know why exactly, but I think it could show off its appeal at just the right time to excite the crowd. Yup, that's what "<nickname>" suggests to me anyhow. It makes me think of an old couple."
	5, C, J, Q, X, f, m, t, <square>, <person/snowman>, <double z>, <space>, <period> "That this Pokémon is destined to have some ups and downs in life! I'd say that the future in store for it will be anything but mediocre! This name is like when you finally meet a Shiny Pokémonin the wild— and then youknock it out with a critical hit! Arrrghhh! Yup, that's what "<nickname>" sounds like to my ears. I see lots of drama for this one."
	6, D, K, R, Y, g, n, u, <Triangle>, <neutral face>, É, <Spade>, <Club>, !, (, /, =, <left apos> "The name "<nickname>." Well, <name>, I have to say that nickname seems a bit lacking in the love department, you know? If you want to understand your <Pokémon> a bit better, how about renaming it "<name>"? With the same name, maybe you'd understand your Pokémon as much as you understand yourself!"
	0, 7, E, L, S, Z, a, h, o, v, <happy face>, <turned square>, <heart>, ), <right apos> "The name "<nickname>" really captures the love you have for your Pokémon, <name>! My, my... How can I say this? It's like... It's like, <name>, <nickname> completes you. <nickname> supports you a lot, doesn't it? You have noticed that, right? You'd better notice it!"

	"This nickname, well... You did spend <number> second(s) on deciding it, so I guess that tells you all you need to know! <name>, you really put a lot into that name, didn't you?"

	"But you know, <name>, I've got to say that you pick some fine nicknames for your Pokémon. I hope you'll continue looking after <nickname> with as much care as you clearly put into its name. I hope fate has it in store for us to meet again!"
