Search2Catch
	A program that reviews trainers' encounters with hidden Pokémon. This program updates whenever the DexNav recognizes a hidden Pokémon and the Pokémon is either encountered or scared away. If the Pokémon runs away without being encountered due to the player entering another battle or moving too far away, the program does not update.
	""Search2Catch"! it's the program where we cover the amazing encounters that bring Pokémon to their Trainers! A Trainer named <name> found a hidden Pokémon in <location>."
	"I had my fingers crossed for him/her! <Name>! There's a/an cute/lovely/great/epic Pokémon right there in front of you! Do your best! Your fated encounter is waiting!"
	If the player took less than 60 seconds to encounter the Pokémon:
	"<Name>'s sneaky steps were beautiful and light! I think it only took <number> second(s) to reach that Pokémon!"
	If the player took 60 seconds or more to encounter the Pokémon:
	"<Name> is quite the cautious one. He/She's taking his/her time to approach slowly."
	If the player runs and scares it away:
	"But then... <name> walked right on by! <Name>! Oh, <name>! How blind are you?! Wasn't it in your field of vision? Couldn't you see that cute <Pokémon>?! I bet you're just the kind of Trainer who complains about how they can never meet new Pokémon! I'm so disappointed!"
	If the player walks and scares it away:
	"And so <name> walked on incredibly slowly! One step... and then another... <Name> is being so careful! And that's why... That's why... it got away! <Name> looked a bit sad as he/she watched the <Pokémon> fade into the distance."
	If the player encountered the Pokémon and....
		The player defeated it:
		"Then a Lv.<number> <Pokémon> was encountered... The <Pokémon> was driven back by a powerful attack though! Being a strong Trainer is lovely, but you end up expecting more from your opponents. Hopefully we can all find that one special Pokémon someday!"
		The player caught it:
		"Then <name> finally found that one special Lv.<number> <Pokémon>! They fell for each other the moment they met! The <Pokémon> looked so happy going into the <Poké Ball>!"
		The player blacked out:
		"Then <name> met a Lv.<number> <Pokémon>. It looks like our fearless Trainer was driven back by a fierce attack! Seeing <name> run for the Pokémon Center was a bit sad."
		The player ran:
		"Then <name> finally found that one special Lv.<number> <Pokémon>! <Name> ran away, though! I was so disappointed! Pokémon are nothing to be scared of! They're just waiting for you to approach them!"
		It ran away: "Then <name> finally found that one special Lv.<number> <Pokémon>! Although the only one who thought so might have been <name>! That <Pokémon> ran away in a flash! Of course, I just felt so sorry for him/her that I couldn't find the words to say."
	"That's all for today's stories of new encounters. Be sure to use the DexNav for more lovely new encounters that are hiding in your everyday life."
