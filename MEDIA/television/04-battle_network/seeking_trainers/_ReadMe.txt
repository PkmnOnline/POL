Seeking Trainers

A program where Gabby and Tyreport on Trainers they battle around Hoenn.

	""Seeking Trainers" Gabby: I'm coming to you today from <location>! We're here today to scout a wonderful talent. The Trainer I've got my eye on today is <name>!"
	For their first battle with the player:
		"I have a feeling about this Trainer! Well, the fastest way to check a Trainer's abilities is to battle! We'll begin our investigation right away! ... So we battled, but Ty and I suffered a spectacularly crushing defeat! <name> is exceedingly strong. Now to share my thoughts on our battle..."
	For subsequent battles with the player:
		"I may have battled <name> before, but he/she certainly seems to have gotten stronger. I expected no less from a Trainer who I had my eye on! Well, the fastest way to check a Trainer's abilities is to battle! We'll begin our investigation right away! ... So we battled, but Ty and I suffered a spectacularly crushing defeat! <name> is exceedingly strong. Now to share my thoughts on our battle..."
	If the player Mega-Evolved a Pokémon:
		"That was so moving! <Pokémon> showed off its Mega Evolution for us! I got so excited that I was in no condition to battle!"
	If not:
		"The team of <Pokémon> and <Pokémon> was the best! Seeing those two help each other out during the battle was wonderful! That <move> came from the friendship between <Pokémon> and <Pokémon>!"
	"The victorious Trainer had this to say about the battle: "<quote>." <Pokémon>, <Pokémon>, and <quote>. There's something deep about those words. Good Trainers sure do have good things to say! We'll see you again on our next broadcast!"

In Generation 3, this show was titled "In Search of Trainers"

	"Hi! Today I'm visiting an area near <place fought>. We're trying to spot some up-and-coming new talent in the field. Today, we turned our lens on the Trainer <player>. There's something about this Trainer that piqued our interest."
	For any battle after the first:
		"We've battled <player> before, but we can attest that the Trainer has most definitely improved from before. I knew we were onto someone special when we spotted this Trainer!"
		"The best way to determine how strong a Trainer is… Well, the fastest way is to battle. And so we began our investigation! … … That's how we ended up in battle with <player>. In a dominating performance we were flattened, rolled up, and tossed aside! <player> is ruthlessly strong… Here's our impressions after having battled our featured Trainer."
	If Gabby and Ty were unable to land a successful attack:
		"...I lost confidence in myself as a result of our encounter. We were beaten before we could launch a single attack. Ohhh... Snivel... In spite of that, <player>'s battles are worth seeing. I recommend confident Trainers to challenge <player>."
	If Gabby and Ty were able to land a successful attack and none of the player's Pokémon fainted:
		"The combination of <final Pokémon 1> and <final Pokémon 2> was divine! The sight of them--<final Pokémon 1> and <final Pokémon 2>--selflessly supporting each other in the thick of battle… It was a marvelous sight to behold! <finishing move> was the move the Trainer used last in our battle. The move <move> is <Pokémon> and <Pokémon>'s sign of friendship!"
	If at least one of player's Pokémon fainted:
		"Honestly speaking, I thought that I might even be pretty good. While we did end up losing, we did have a hotly contested battle. But if you're struggling against me, you have a ways to go, <player>!"
	"After our battle, we asked <player> for a succinct summary. The Trainer replied, "<word>." <player>'s Pokémon<final Pokémon 1> and <final Pokémon 2>… And "<word>"… Mmm! That's deep! There's deep significance behind that quote! It's no surprise--a good Trainer has good things to say. That's all for today! See you all again on our next broadcast!"
