"Unova News": Next up, we have news of a Pokémon that can see the future.
Ms. D: I was elegantly strolling along the beach. Then I saw a Pokémon off in the distance. It was looking intently in my direction for some reason.
It just sat there staring, so at first, I thought it was looking at me, but..
It suddenly pointed to the ocean and disappeared!
I wanted to know what it was pointing at, so I walked toward the ocean...
And then! A big boulder fell down from the cliff above!
Right where I had just been standing!
I'm sure that Pokémon can see the future! There's no doubt about it!
It protected the future of a beautiful lady like me."
Unova News: ...Uh-huh. This concluded the report on Ms. D.
