PokéQuiz
	PokéQuiz is a television program that asks three kids to identify an international equivalent of a Pokémon's English name. (Originally only quizzed the Japanese names)

				Pronunciation guide
					Supposed name origin
		Quill, Ill, Zill
Squirtle
	None
		Turzen
		Zenzen
			Zenigame
				Zeh-nee-ga-me
					"Zeni" is an old-fashioned word for money. Squirtle's shells look like old coins, so that's how they got their name! You can't use them as coins, though.
Turtwig
	None
		Torunae
		Tornado
			Naetle
				None
					"Nae" means seedling in Japanese, and Turtwig has a seedling growing out of its head!
