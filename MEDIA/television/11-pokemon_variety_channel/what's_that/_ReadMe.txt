What's That?

It follows a reporter and a Watchog named Watchy Watchog, presumably owned by the reporter, as they find and identify held items introduced in Generation V.

	Lady: Hello! It's time for the "What's That?" show, were we talk about wonderful items! Today we are talking about the <item>!Watchy Watchog, have you heard of the <item>?
	Watchy: Tch tch cha! (...<Watchy's translated answer>...)
	Lady: Amazing! You know it! OK, well, I'll explain it anyway!

Air Balloon
	Come on! Of course I haven't!
		Amazingly, a Pokémon holding the Air Balloon will float up in the air! That means Ground-type moves won't work against it at all! But, the balloon pops if the Pokémon gets hit with an attack, so be careful!
			Oh no! I popped it!!
				Hey! Nice one, clumsy!
Absorb Bulb
	Come on! Of course I haven't!
		When a Pokémon holding an Absorb Bulb is hit by a Water-type attack, its Sp. Atk stat goes up!
			But you can only use it once. Here, you can have this used one!
				Don't pawn your garbage off on me!
Big Root
	Come on! It's big and it's a root!
		Holding the Big Root boosts the effect of moves that restore HP by 30%!
			OK! Shall we go?
				Hey! What's the deal with the trowel?
Binding Band
	Come on! Of course I haven't!
		The Binding Band increases the power of binding moves, like Wrap!
			Well, that's it for today!
				Hey? That's it?!
Bright Powder
	Come on! Like I'd know!
		Holding the Bright Powder drops your opponent's accuracy to 90%! Oh, by the way, Lax Incense has the same effect as well!
			OK, Watchy! Come at me!
				Ooh, shiny!
Cell Battery
	Come on! Of course I haven't!
		When a Pokémon holding a Cell Battery is hit by an Electric-type attack, its Attack stat goes up!
			But you can only use it once. I already used mine, so I can't give it to you!
				I didn't want it anyway!
Eviolite
	Come on! Like I'd know!
		When you give the Eviolite to a Pokémon that hasn't evolved yet... Its Defense and Sp. Def both rise sharply! Isn't that amazing?!
			So, we'll see you later, then.
				What? That was a really short show!
Expert Belt
	Come on! Like I'd know!
		Holding the Expert Belt when attacking makes that attack do more damage when it's super effective! An amazing 20% more, in fact!
			OK, then...
				Hey! Why are you putting that on?!
Float Stone
	Come on! Of course I haven't!
		When you give the Float Stone to a Pokémon, its weight decreases!
			Let's try giving one to Watchy right now!
				Hey! Are you calling me fat?!
Iron Ball
	C'mon! How could I know that?
		The one holding an Iron Ball can be hit by Ground-type moves, even if the holder is a Flying-type Pokémon or has the Levitate Ability!
			So, let's demonstrate! Watchy, heads up! Catch!
				Hey! Do I look like I can fly?
Leftovers
	I always clean my plate, so...
		When a Pokémon is holding Leftovers, a small fraction of its HP is healed every turn! Isn't that neat?!
			Oh! That thing on the floor there... Could it be?
				Hey! Why are you picking that up?
Life Orb
	Life? I've got a bad feeling about this...
		Holding the Life Orb makes attacks do 30% more damage! Unfortunately, the holder's HP goes down by 10%...
			Um, anyway, there's a lot more to it, but, um... See you next time!
				What? You're just ending it there?
Metronome
	I've heard of the name, at leastHolding the Metronome and using the same move continuously makes that move do more and more damage! If the holder uses the same move six times in a row, the damage can double!
		So, here we go! Once, twice...Hey! Stop the music!
Red Card
	Come on! Of course I haven't!
		When the Pokémon holding the Red Card is attacked, the attacker is thrown out of the battle.
			Just so you know, Watchy, I'm holding a Red Card right now!
				Hey! I'm not going to attack you!
Ring Target
	Come on! Of course I haven't!
		If a Pokémon holds the Ring Target, even attacks that would usually have no effect will hit it!
			That reminds me, I have a present for you, Watchy! Your very own Ring Target!
				Hey! That's not very nice!
Rocky Helmet
	Come on! Of course I haven't!
		When an attack does physical damage to a Pokémon holding the Rocky Helmet, the attacker takes damage, too.
			I'll try it! So I put it on, like so, and... OK, Watchy, hit me with your best shot!
				No fair! You're not a Pokémon!
Shed Shell
	Come on! Like I'd know!
		When a Pokémon is holding the Shed Shell, it can switch out of battle, even when it usually wouldn't be able to!
			Still, I wonder what kind of Pokémon this shell came from?
				Hey! What are you looking at me for?
Shell Bell
	I've heard of the name, at least...
		Suppose you land an attack while holding the Shell Bell. Your HP would be restored by one-eighth of the damage done!
			The Shell Bell sure has a pretty sound, doesn't it?
				Hey! That's it? Just listening to it?
Zoom Lens
	Come on! Like I'd know!
		Holding the Zoom Lens makes accuracy go up 20%! But it only works when the holder moves after the target.
			My motto is, strike first and strike hard!Hey! That's an evil-looking stare!
