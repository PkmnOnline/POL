	Cilan, Chili, and Cress
		Recently, I saw Striaton Gym's three Gym Leaders, and they were all out of order! Like, Chili was Cilan, and Cilan was Cress!
			Hmmm. Well, I'm not saying you're crazy, but...are you sure they weren't just standing in front of a mirror?

	Cheren
		Recently, I saw Cheren making his thumb and middle finger into a circle like glasses. He said he gave up his glasses so he can focus on Pokemon battles, but maybe Cheren actually misses them.
			Hm... Maybe a circle is just a circle!
Bonadventure
	Lenora
		I saw it... Lenora, in the middle of the night...talking to bones in the museum! I also heard a man's guttural laugh... It was scary!
			I see. Very horrific. But, I'll bet it was just her husband, Hawes. He has a weird laugh...
RoxieForever
	Roxie
		This is a story about the first time I ever went to one of Roxie's shows! Many fans collapsed from the toxic power of her songs. Roxie's really a toxic shock to the system, isn't she?!
			Maybe they were just too excited and fainted. Make sure to drink lots of fluids when you go to concerts!
Compoundeyes Wrestler
	Burgh
		When I went to meet Burgh. It was like he had been licking the honeycomb walls! That guy likes to eat!
			Now that is a surprise... But, I wonder if he was just admiring his own face reflected on those walls... That's also weird though...
Molt
	Burgh
		When I went to meet Burgh, he was shooting cocoon silk from his hands and decorating his walls with it! Could he actually be a Pokémon?!
			Now that is a surprise... But, I wonder if he was just carrying that silk in his hands? We are talking about Burgh, though...
Shocking Supermodel
	Elesa
		The Gym Leader Elesa said that Nimbasa's Pokémon can dance a nimble bossa! Nobody laughed, but I thought it was really funny! What do you think?
			Hmmm... It really seems like Elesa needs to come up with a sneakier pen name. Well, whatever!
Veildrifter
	Clay
		You know how Gym Leader Clay never takes off his hat? Well, the other day I finally saw him take it off... And underneath his big hat was a fluffy knit hat! He wears two hats! Weird, huh?
			Hmm... That seems like it would be way too warm! Still, I wonder if that isn't just Clay's hair sticking up all funny...
Pilotcandidate
	Skyla
		I'm an aspiring Pilot who is a huge fan of Skyla! I couldn't take it anymore, and I peeked into her Gym... and it looked like she was flying with the propeller on her head! Isn't that amazing?! Maybe she doesn't even need a plane!
		Hmm... That is mysterious! Still, I wonder if she was just using the cannons in her Gym to fly...
FlyingMaiden
	Skyla
		I wanted to ride on Skyla's plane, so I went to the Gym! Skyla was in the back of the Gym, and she sneezed! At that very instant, a tremendous wind blew me clear out of the Gym!
		Hmm... That is amazing! Still, I suspect that wind might not have had anything to do with her...
TheFridge
	Brycen
		Brycen is too cool! He's always acting like Mr. Tough Guy, like he doesn't even feel the cold...but recently, I heard him sneeze inside his chilly Gym!
			I guess even a super-cool Gym Leader can catch a cold. Feel better soon, Brycen!
Opelucitizen
	Drayden
		Drayden is a man among men who puts himself on the line to protect the people living in our city. He always gives his all, even in training. According to his training schedule I just happened upon, he does:
1. 10,000 sit-ups
2. 10,000 push-ups
3. 10,000 squats
			Isn't that outrageous? Huh... How old is that guy anyway?
Madame Scale
	Drayden andIris
		I'm from Opelucid City, and I just went home for the first time in a long time. I saw Drayden and Iris counting up a big handful of coins! Isn't that setting a bad example for kids, flaunting your wealth like that?
			Hmmm... That's living the high life! But you know, the Opelucid Gym Badge is shiny like a coin... Maybe you saw wrong?
MisterFisher
	Marlon
		Marlon was swimming the other day, and he just kept going faster until he shot out of the water and into the sky! That swimming style could completely dominate the world of swimming.
			Hm... That is amazing, but nobody else can do that. Actually, can you even call jumping into the sky swimming?
