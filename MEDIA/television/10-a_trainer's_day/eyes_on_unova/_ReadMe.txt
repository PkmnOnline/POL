An older man from Opelucid City who loves musicals!
Hello! I’ve heard that you hand out Musical Props every day!
Man: Indubitably! ♪ C’est vrai! ♪
Host: Oh dear. There’s really no need to sing about it, sir...
Man: ♪ Beeee-caaaause ♪ bee-cause ♪...
Host: OK, OK, thank you very much! That was our report from Opelucid City!

A talented Pokémon massage therapist who lives in Castelia City!
Hello! So what got you interested in Pokémon massage therapy?
Woman: At first, I wanted to be a massage therapist for people, but one day I didn't have any human clients, so I decided to practice on a Pokémon. It was so happy and so cute afterward! So I decided to switch my practice to Pokémon massage exclusively.
Host: Wow, is that so? That means you can do massage for people too, right?! If you don't mind, my neck has been killing me... ...Oh, well, that's... erk... Maybe you're out of practice... ow ow OW! OK, that's enough, thanks! That was...ow... our report from Castelia City.

This wonderful lady who lives right here in Driftveil City!
Hello! You are the lady who is famous for being obsessed with TMs, right?
Woman: That's right. Are you familiar with a move called Spite?
Host: Um... I've heard of it..
Woman: I will not speak to you unless you bring me a Pokémon that knows Spite!
Host: Well, I think we can confirm that you're every bit as eccentric as people say! And that was our report from Driftveil City.
