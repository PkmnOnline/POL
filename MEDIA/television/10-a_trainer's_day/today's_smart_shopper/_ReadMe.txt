Today's Smart Shopper
	A program that talks about top sellers at Poké Marts. It focuses on an item bought by a player on a recent Poké Mart trip. The program updates daily, and only when a player has purchased at least 10 of an item. The biggest quantity & spender of the day is chosen.

"Interviewer: Greetings! How are all our viewers doing out there? It's time for Today's Smart Shopper! Today, I've come to this great shop in <location> to ask which items have been flying off the shelves lately. Let's ask one of the staff right now! So, what's your number-one seller?"
"Clerk: Well, thank you for asking. I'd say that <item> have been selling really well lately. I even had this one Trainer named <name> come in the other day to buy <amount> of them!"
	Variable lines:
	"Interviewer: Oh, that reminds me! Speaking of <item>, I bought one myself the other day. <Item> are handy and wonderful and, well... They're just great to have on you!"
	"Interviewer: Really? <Item>? And <amount> of them?! I never even imagined that anyone would buy so many at once. I never buy more than one or two at a time myself."
	"Interviewer: I remember one time, way back when, I bought a whole lot of <item>, too. But I had so many left over that I ended up with real buyer's regret. Now I just try to buy what I need. Oops! But I guess talking about myself doesn't really help!"
	"Interviewer: Phew! It takes some deep pockets to buy up <amount> <item> at once! I bet that <name> of yours was getting ready for an adventure! I know I always want to have a/an <item> or <amount> for any journey that I'm on!"
	"Clerk: Well, it was a really great sale, so I guess it's natural to want to stock up!"
	"Interviewer: Hmm, hmmm... I guess that <name> must really know how to spot a deal. Let's see, the total for that purchase was... Just <cost>?! Whoa! That really was a great deal! Well, that's all we have time for today, but catch us again for more of the best deals! Bye for now, bargain hunters!"
