Patrat
	Peeps
		Striaton City
			In a two-story home in Striaton City, the Patrat called Peeps lives with its Trainer. Its Trainer is also a Pokémon Breeder who is raising many Pokémon! And when its Trainer is really busy, Peeps lends a hand...or a paw! It plays with all the other Pokémon to give them some exercise and sometimes even gets them to settle down for the night. Today, Peeps has started a lively game of tag with some of the other Pokémon its Trainer is taking care of. They'll sleep well tonight after all that running!
Zweilous
	Chow
		Opelucid City
			Near the gate of Opelucid City, the Zweilous Chow lives with its Trainer. Both Chow and its Trainer really love to eat! Anything you serve them, they'll gobble it right up. They even compete against each other in eating contests. Back when Chow was a Deino, its Trainer could eat faster... but now that Chow has evolved into a Zweilous, it has an extra mouth, so that's a big advantage! It's built up quite a winning streak with its two hungry hungry heads. That was the Zweilous, Chow, who eats a lot, but not as much as my Zweilous. On the next "Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that is amazing... but, of course, not as amazing as mine!
Minccino
	Julie
		Nimbasa City
			It's waiting in the wings in the Nimbasa City Musical for its cue to go on stage. This Minccino is named Julie! Julie and its Trainer have put so much effort into training for the Musical. They've worked really hard! And for Julie, the goal every day is to be the one that gets the most time in the spotlight! Julie and its Trainer have a real fire in their hearts when it comes to performing! That was the Minccino Julie, who stands out, just not as much as my Minccino. On the next "Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that's really good at napping, but not as good as mine!
Darumaka
	Gance
		Castelia City
			In a Castelia City office building, a Darumaka named Gance is having a Pokémon battle. Its Trainer is a Clerk ♂ who works in the building. This company takes Pokémon battles very seriously. In fact, work schedules, meeting agendas, and other important matters are all decided by battles! And so its Trainer won't have to work on weekends or do really boring jobs, Gance does its very best in every battle. The Darumaka Gance is a Pokémon with fighting spirit, but not as much as my Darumaka! On the next "Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that stands out, but not as much as mine!
Purrloin
	Meg
		Nacrene City
			In Nacrene City's old warehouses, the Purrloin Meg lives with its Trainer. Meg's Trainer runs a store, and every morning, Meg goes to work with her. At the store, Meg is its Trainer's partner! It sits outside as a mascot and draws customers into the store. Today, it's even carrying a sign for the store to attract even more customers! That was the Purrloin Meg, who works hard, but not as hard as my Purrloin. On the next "Your Pokémon," we will introduce a little Pokémon with a lot of fighting spirit, but not as much as mine!
Cubchoo
	Kodie
		Driftveil City
			In a small house in Driftveil City, the Cubchoo named Kodie lives with its Trainer. Kodie's Trainer is a Worker in the Cold Storage. Kodie tags along to work and takes a nap right there in the Cold Storage. Even when it's cold enough that its Trainer's teeth are chattering, Kodie naps away in perfect comfort! That was Kodie, who's very relaxed, but not as relaxed as my Cubchoo! On the next "Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that is patient, but not as patient as mine!
