Move
	Description in the show
		Usefulness in real life
After You
	After You is a move filled with the spirit of give and take, where you allow the target to attack right after you do.
		In practical terms, if you see a new dish at a restaurant that you're a little nerous about, you can use this move to make someone else taste it first!
Bestow
	Bestow is a very generous move where you pass an item to the target.
		There's an effective use for this move in everyday life. Sometimes you receive a gift that will clearly cause trouble, right? You can use this move right away to... No, actually, you'd better wait until the person who gave you the gift has left! But then you can use the move to pass your unwanted gift off to someone else.
Chip Away
	Chip Away is a very persistent move that keeps striking and ignores all of the target's stat changes.
		In everyday life, this move might be handy for winning an argument with a really stubborn person!
Echoed Voice
	Echoed Voice is a very rugged move whose power grows when you use it in successive turns.
		I bet you can think of ways to use this move in everyday life without my help! You know how sometimes you have to tell your kids the same thing over and over before they listen? In this situation, parents, teachers, and friends can all use this move and it will be very effective!
Foul Play
	Foul Play is a move that gets better the more physically strong your opponent is.
		It's a little sneaky, but you can use it in everyday life. For example, if you're terrible at sports, and you're going up against a big, powerful opponent... Well, it might be considered cheating, but it would get the job done!
Guard Split
	Guard Split is a very balanced move that takes the defensive power of both sides and divides it up evenly.
		Here's a practical application. If you and a friend get lost in the mountains, you could use this move to share your defenses so you can both withstand the cold. It's a great way to test the dynamics of a relationship!
Hone Claws
	Hone Claws is a very clean move where the user's claws are honed and sharpened.
		Ladies could use this move in everyday life. It's like a super-powered manicure!
Low Sweep
	Low Sweep is a simple but wild move. It's a swift kick to the lower part of the target's legs.
		It can also be handy in everyday life. Just imagine a lady wearing a short skirt, and she has to kick someone... She can use this move without causing any embarrassment to herself.
Magic Room
	Magic Room is a very basic move that causes items to have no effect for a certain amount of turns.
		There's an effective use for this move in everyday life. For example, suppose a child is begging you to buy a toy. If you use this move at the exact moment the child picks up the toy, it will counter the "I want this" effect!
Psyshock
	Psyshock is a very indirect move where the user attacks with a psychic wave that takes physical form.
		It can be used effectively in everyday life, too. For example, sometimes you want to practice comedy routines by yourself, right? If you time this move right, you can smack yourself around for some amazing physical comedy!
Quash
	Quash is a fantastically stubborn move that makes the target's move go last.
		As for how to use it in life... If, for example, someone you are dating is about to break up with you... Well, you can see how using this move quickly could exhibit dramatic effects!
Quiver Dance
	Quiver Dance is a beautiful, graceful move that raises the user's Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed stats.
		There's an effective use for this move in everyday life. For example, suppose you were invited to your friend's birthday, but you forgot to bring a gift. You could use this move when you arrive at the party, as a distraction... And then it would make you harder to hit if your friend got angry!
Reflect Type
	Reflect Type is a very conformist move that makes yourtype match your target's type.
		This works really well if you're spending time with someone and you decide you have nothing in common. Use this move and... Voilà! Instant common ground!
Shell Smash
	Shell Smash is a possibly risky move where the user's Speed, Attack, and Sp. Atk stats increase at the expense of defensive power.
		There's an effective use for this move in everyday life. For example, how about when you switch to a new school? This move could be the brand-new start you might need. It could change your whole life!
Sky Drop
	Sky Drop is a dramatic move where the target is taken high into the sky and then slammed into the ground.
		There's an effective use for this move in everyday life: Showing off! You could use this move on yourself, right? If you go fluttering up into the sky, you'll impress everyone! It's an extremely dramatic performance! Just brace yourself for the landing...
Smack Down
	Smack Down is a classic and primitive move where something is thrown at a flying target to bring it to the ground.
		There's an effective use for this move in everyday life. For example, suppose you sent air mail to someone, but then you change your mind and don't want them to read it! You could use this move to knock it down before it gets to them.
Soak
	Well, Soak is a sloshy move that turns the target into a Water type.
		Wondering how you could possibly use this move in everyday life? What if you spilled a drink during an important occasion? If you use this move right, it might not matter at all!
Synchronoise
	Synchronoise is an exclusive move that only attacks everything of the same type as the user.
		If a person who has the same personality and characteristics as you shows up at school or work, you could use this move to distinguish yourself.
Venoshock
	Venoshock covers the target in a special kind of poisonous liquid. It's a truly spicy move!
		Sometimes, when you're cooking, you dish just needs a little extra pinch of something. Well, you can see how using this move quickly could add a dangerous flavor!
