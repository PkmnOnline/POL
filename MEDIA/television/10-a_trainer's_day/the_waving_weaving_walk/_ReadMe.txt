I wonder where I should walk next.

Ability
	Description
Analytic
	Analytic is great for slower Pokémon. If a Pokémon with Analytic goes last in a battle, its move's power will be boosted!
Anticipation
	If the opponent has a super effective move or one-hit KO move, Anticipation will warn you so you can be prepared!
Cloud Nine
	Cloud Nine is great for travelers. It prevents effects from weather!
Contrary
	Contrary makes stat changes go topsy-turvy! For example, if a Pokémon with Contrary gets hit by a move that lowers its Speed, it will have the opposite effect! That's right. Its Speed will increase!
Cursed Body
	If a Pokémon with Cursed Body is damaged by a move, sometimes that move can be disabled so the foe can't use it anymore!
Damp
	If a Pokémon with Damp is in battle, moves like Explosion and Selfdestruct can't be used.
Download
	A Pokémon with Download can take advantage of its opponent's weaknesses. If the opponent's Defense is lower than its Sp. Def, the Pokémon's Attack will be boosted. If the opponent's Sp. Def is lower than its Defense, the Pokémon's Sp. Atk will be boosted.
Harvest
	If a Pokémon with Harvest eats a Berry during battle, the Berry may regenerate at the end of the turn! It's like an all-you-can-eat Berry buffet!
Klutz
	Held items have no effect on a Pokémon with Klutz. It could even hold an Iron Ball without being weighed down!
Lightningrod
	If a Pokémon with Lightningrod is in battle, any Electric-type move will hit it. And getting hit by an Electric-type move boosts the Pokémon's Sp. Atk stat!
Magic Bounce
	Magic Bounce works like the move Magic Coat, but it's "on" all the time!
Mold Breaker
	A Pokémon with Mold Breaker can completely ignore its opponent's Ability when attacking.
Moody
	During a battle, Moody raises one stat and lowers another at the end of each turn.
Pickup
	A Pokémon with Pickup can get the effect of an item an opponent has used in battle. It also picks up various items when it is not battling.
Prankster
	Prankster gives priority to status moves like Screech!
Rattled
	If a Pokémon with Rattled is hit by a Ghost-, Dark-, or Bug-type move, its Speed will go up!
Sheer Force
	A Pokémon with Sheer Force gets a power boost for moves that normally have additional effects, but the additional effects won't occur!
Sturdy
	One-hit KO attacks don't work on a Pokémon with Sturdy. It hangs on to that one last HP!
Weak Armor
	When a Pokémon with Weak Armor is hit by a physical attack, its Defense will be lowered, but its Speed will go up!
