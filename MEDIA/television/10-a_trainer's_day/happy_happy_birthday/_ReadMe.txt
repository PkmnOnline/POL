Happy, Happy Birthday!

A program that celebrates Trainers' birthdays. This program updates when it's the player's birthday.

""Happy, Happy Birthday!" Just who is the Trainer that celebrated their birthday recently? ... It's <name>! Woo-hoo! Happy birthday, <name>! What a joyous occasion! <name> looked so happy to celebrate his/her birthday at thePokémon Center. The <Pokémon> that <name> always takes such good care of was saying "happy birthday," with a smile, too! I wonder how old <name> is now... I hope that no matter how old <name> gets, he/she keeps on living the good life with Pokémon! One last time before we go— happy birthday, <name>!"
