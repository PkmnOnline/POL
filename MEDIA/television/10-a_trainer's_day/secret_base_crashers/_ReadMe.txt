	Depending on the type of Super-Secret Base:
	"There's no mountain too high nor river too wide to stop us on Secret Base Crashers! Today's Secret Base was found in... <Location>! That hole in the cliff over there, no matter how you look at it, must be a Secret Base!"
	"There's no mountain too high nor river too wide to stop us on Secret Base Crashers! Today's Secret Base was found in... <Location>! Those vines hanging from that tree over there... No matter how you see this scene, it must be a Secret Base!
	"There's no mountain too high nor river too wide to stop us on Secret Base Crashers! Today's Secret Base was found in... <Location>! That clump of grass over there... No matter how you look at it, must be a Secret Base!
