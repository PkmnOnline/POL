	"Li'l MC: OK! Off we go! Hmm, where should we go to check the latest trends?"
	"Vet MC: Good question. Let's start by asking what has been trending with the typical kind of <Trainer class> we see around Hoenn."
	"Li'l MC: OK, OK! Let's see. When I think of a typical <Trainer class>... That's it! Of course! The one Trainer we all thought of, right? It's gotta be <name>! If we ask <name>, I'm sure we'll be on the real cusp of cool!"
