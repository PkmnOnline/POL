TM Treasures
	A show that talks about TMs a player has used recently, and ones they have never used. Whenever a player uses a TM, the program randonly selects an unused TM in the player's Bag and reports on them both. If there is no unused TM in the player's Bag, an alternate report is made.
	If the player has an unused TM in their bag:
	"This episode of TM Treasures is brought to you bu Poké Mart. Today's TM Treasure is... There it is! That disc shape! It's TM<unused number>! It hasn't even been used once. TM<unused number>... Is this <name>'s Bag? The TM for <unused move> slumbers inside the Bag just waiting to be awakened. TM<used number>, the TM for <used move>, has been used though, so why?! TMs can be used as many times as you like! Before we go, we'll teach you the words to wake it up!"
	If the player has used every TM in their bag:
	"This episode of TM Treasures is brought to you bu Poké Mart. Today's TM Treasure is... There it is! That disc shape! It's TM<number>! It's been used with care. TM<number>... Is this <name>'s Bag? This trainer knows how to make good use of TMs. They must know pretty well how they can be used as many times as you like! Before we go, we'll thank you for your diligence!"
	Randomly selected ending:
	"TMs... aren't just for show! Thank you."
	"TMs... are worthless if you don't use them! Thank you."
	"TMs you don't use... are just like scrap wood! Thank you."
	"Your TMs... are crying! Thank you.
	"TMs... You're missing out if you don't use 'em! Thank you."
