The Pokemon World is based upon the real world foremost. The series continually references real-world locations directly, this must be acknowledged of course - whether by error or intention, these references have made repeatedly. This issue coincides with other real-world reference wildlife crossovers across all forms of the medium.

Many of these reference issues can be resolved with the following explanations:

While the franchise uses "Region" to describe the playable world, they also reference Countries as well. It stands to reason that Region is used to describe the jurisdiction of a Pokemon League or Ranger Union (both seem to carry equal authority in their respective locales), while geographic Countries remain distinctive and still comprehended, although rarely used in local contexts. For this reason, Japan, America (note: it does not specify the USA), and even Germany and France have been directly referenced - further cementing the geographical regions naming being canonical.

Wild animals have been stated to explicitly not exist within the Pokemon World, but actual series medium have repeatedly depicted and referenced animals existing in direct contradiction to this. One may write this off as simply being that the equivalent Pokemon had not been developed at the time of depiction, but that is a very poor excuse; it does nothing to address the direct references made. Therefore, while it is best to avoid creating such references when possible, some references are unavoidable, such as in Species information. One can safely assume that animals do in truth exist within the Pokemon World, but are generally unseen in the games due to the nature of the medium (all sprites take up memory, after all). Noteworthy: butterflies appear in battle backgrounds in X and Y, and fish is served in restaurants. It is best to utilize Pokemon for backdrop wildlife in any scenario.

This project aims for modularity, thus each game region is sorted into its geographic continent and country, then subdivided into its region. The only exceptions to this are the Secret Bases, Distortion World, and Dreamscape, which are non-geographic areas. Areas with unknown geographic equivalents will be kept with their respective origin region data until otherwise reconciled. Map stitching should be handled in a way that missing modules (including sub-area-maps) are treated as walled dead-ends, and should include the pertinent fly-map data so everything pieces together correctly, including disparate areas. For this same reason, all references to Minigames within the map data should include a fallback in case the Minigame module is not present.

In regards to the Fly maps, the same coordinate data would be used for Soaring. When players attempt to fly beyond the bounds of a given region's Soar map, it would in turn pull out even further into a global view, allowing for international Soaring. For all Fly/Soar maps, an index of shortcuts for navigating the region's areas in sequence would also need to be designated. This index would need to be cross-checked against the present maps, of course, so if any map module is missing it will not be visible to the player for selection in the navigation.
