Pal Park [Minigame]
	The Kanto Pal Park neighbors the Safari Zone, and consists of a single building and enclosed outdoor area. The Pokemon found within this area are contributed by players from other regions, with rare Pokemon being worth more points. Players accrue a hidden "credit average" of points by contributing Pokemon, which is then used to determine what the player will encounter in the park. Players are scored for the Catching Show based on the speed and value of their captures. High-scores earn an additional prize on top of the usual berry reward. Each week the High Score is reset.
