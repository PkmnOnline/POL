Rocket Hideout
	A four-floored underground complex beneath Celadon City. It is a secret base built and used by Team Rocket to facilitate and administer their operations.
	Entrance - The hideout is primarily accessible through the Celadon Department Store's elevator, albeit requiring the use of a Lift Key.
	Exit - An emergency escape exit leads into the Celadon Game Corner, but it is one-way only.
	A second secret entrance and exit through the Celadon Condominiums also exists, but it is only accessible by a hidden elevator in the Boss' Office, and also requires the use of the Lift Key.
