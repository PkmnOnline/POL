Slot Machines
	This minigame operates on Coins. This version represents the slot machines from the Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum games.

	These slot machines can only be played for 3 coins at a time. However, bonus round spins only cost 1 coin. Slot machines in the fourth generation control slightly differently than in the past three generations. Instead of simply stopping the reels from left to right with one button, reels are now stopped with their own buttons: the left reel uses the Y button, the center reel uses the B button, and the right reel uses the A button. The jackpot has been reduced from 300 coins to only 100, but winning a jackpot also triggers a bonus game. The bonus game in this generation involves trying to keep a Pokémon happy. The Pokémon can be a normal-colored Clefairy, an alternate-colored Clefairy, or a Ditto pretending to be a Clefairy. In the bonus game, each time the slots begin to spin, the Pokémon will point at a wheel. If the player stop the wheels in the order Clefairy points out, the player will land on three Replay symbols and automatically win fifteen coins. Keeping the bonus game going as long as possible involves strategy, and it ends when the Pokémon leaves the scene.
