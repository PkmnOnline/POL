Slot Machines
	This minigame operates on Coins. This version represents the slot machines from the Japanese versions of the Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver games.
	
	These slot machines can only be played for 3 coins at a time, with bonus round spins only costing 1 coin. As players use the slot machine, a Smeargle depicted on a top screen paints on a changing background. A green background signals normal play, red signals it is easier to obtain a 7 or a Poke Ball, and a blue background signals it to be easier to obtain a Pikachu or Marill. Smeargle has an 8-bit signed integer mood value, which starts at 0. When at 0 or lower, the mood value increases by 1 with each spin unless a winning combination occurs. When the mood value is positive, it will increase by a varying amount whenever two Poke Balls or two 7s line up on the first two reels, but the third reel stops in a way that results in a loss. Its mood value must be positive for a background change to occur; the higher the mood value, the more likely a background change will occur. After a background change, the mood value will reset to a random negative value between -1 and -15. Smeargle will pop up thought balloons depending on its mood value after each spin, unless its mood value is 0. 5 Happy Balloons = -13 or lower; 4 Happy Balloons = -12 to -10; 3 Happy Balloons = -9 to -7; 2 Happy Balloons = -6 to -4; 1 Happy Balloon = -3 to -1; 1 Upset Balloon = 1 to 3; 2 Upset Balloons = 4 to 6; 3 Upset Balloons = 7 to 9; 4 Upset Balloons = 10 to 12; 5 Upset Balloons = 13 or higher. The jackpot for three 7s is 100 + 2x, while the jackpot for three Poke Balls is 100 + x, where x starts at 0, may increase whenever a non-jackpot symbol is lined up, and resets to 0 after every bonus game. A bonus game is started by winning a jackpot. Lining up three 7s starts a 15-round bonus game, while three Poke Balls will trigger an 8-round bonus. In this bonus game, players attempt to perfectly line up a randomly chosen one of Johto's starter Pokemon, and the machine may provide some assistance. Bonus game payouts vary depending on success, as well as the slot machine's speed during bonus games. At the end of the bonus game, the background will automatically become red. This lets the player "chain" jackpots and bonus games; however, the bonus game difficulty increases (up to a maximum) with each chained jackpot. The payout for each success in a bonus game is 20 + d * Floor(n / 2) coins, where n is the number of previous successes in the current game and d is 1, 2, or 3, based on the difficulty setting for the current bonus game (the harder, the higher the value). The maximum possible bonus win (not counting the 15 or 8 coins spent) is 447 coins for a 15-round bonus, or 196 for an 8-round bonus. At the end of the bonus game, Smeargle's mood value resets to -n. The bonus round comes into alignment with actual Japanese slot machine laws; no payout lower than the big bonus is higher than 15 coins, and for the big bonus, there is a bonus round where the coins come out 15 at a time; the reels in these games will slip for longer than the 0.19 seconds in certain scenarios, such as the bonus round.
	The reels do not always stop exactly when the player pulls the lever. Sometimes they will slip one or two symbols to get another symbol aligned with the first and second reels (and therefore pay out a prize), but following Japanese slot machine regulations, they will never slip for more than 0.19 seconds (four symbols). They will also slip to avoid paying the Jackpot (and any other prizes) too often, but will also slip in favor of the Jackpot on certain spins. Slips are not common.
	Like real Japanese game parlors, some machines have much better odds than others.
