Slot Machines
	This minigame operates on Coins. This version represents the slot machines from the Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal games.

	The machines can be played for 1, 2, or 3 coins. Paying 1 coin allows payouts only on the center line. Paying 2 allows payouts on all 3 horizontal lines. Paying 3 allows payouts on all 3 horizontal lines as well as the two diagonal lines. Having two 7s line up on the first two reels may cause either a third 7 to line up and pay the jackpot, or end up one space away from lining up to tease the player. Very rarely, Chansey may appear in this situation; it will use Egg Bomb on the third reel repeatedly until the last 7 falls in place for a jackpot. Each Reel consists of the following icons, which when lined up in three results in a payout values: 
	
	7			300
	Poke Ball	50
	Squirtle	10
	Pikachu		8
	Cherries	6
