Slots

By lighting up all four "CAVE" lights at the top of the four lanes, the player makes the "Slots" bonus available. This makes the center hole open, and by shooting the ball into it, the player activates the slots. A slot reel will spin around and eventually slows and stops (the player can make it slow earlier with the 'A' button). The player is then awarded one of the following bonuses:
	Small: A bonus of 100 - 900 points.
	Big: A bonus of 1,000,000 - 9,000,000 points.
	Get: Starts Catch 'Em Mode.
	Evo: Starts Evolution Mode.
	Saver: For the next 30/60/90 seconds, if the ball is drained it will be returned to the plunger and immediately launched (up to twice).
	Pikachu: For the rest of this ball the Pikachu kickback will always save the ball if it goes into the out lanes.
	Upgrade: The ball is upgraded to the next level, increasing the score multiplier.
	Extra: The player receives an extra ball.
	Bonus multiplier: The bonus multiplier is increased.
	Go to bonus: The player immediately plays the next bonus stage.

Note that the player can light up the four "CAVE" lights at any time, however the slots will only become available when the player is not in Catch 'Em, Evolution or Map Move modes and the bonus stage is not available.

Field Mechanics

On each field, various Pokémon appear, taking the place of more traditional pinball obstacles like switches and bumpers.

Red Field
Voltorb: Three appear at the center of the top screen. They serve as bumpers for the Poké Ball and also flip silhouette tiles in Catch 'Em Mode.
Ditto: One is blocking the Evolution Mode trigger hole in the top left corner of the screen until the EVO lights are lit.
Bellsprout: Bellsprout can swallow your ball; if at least two GET lights are lit, Catch 'Em Mode begins when this happens.
Diglett: Hit either of the two Diglett three times to trigger Map Move mode.
Staryu: Hit the button below Staryu to toggle whether or not the Poké Ball upgrade lights above the Voltorb are accessible.

Blue Field
Shellder: Three appear at the center of the top screen. They serve as bumpers for the Poké Ball and also flip silhouette tiles in Catch 'Em Mode.
Cloyster: If the ball is sent to the right from the four-way intersection in the middle of the table, Cloyster will close it in its shell; if at least two GET lights are lit, Catch 'Em Mode begins when this happens.
Slowpoke: If the ball is sent to the left from the four-way intersection in the middle of the table, Slowpoke will swallow it; if all three EVO lights are lit, Evolution Mode begins when this happens.
Poliwag: Hit the red button near Poliwag three times to trigger Map Move mode.
Psyduck: Hitting Psyduck three times will also trigger Map Move mode.

Both Fields
Pikachu: Pikachu can appear under either one of the exit lanes (from which the ball cannot normally be saved); Pikachu's location is toggled with the flipper buttons. If the ball would exit the table via the exit lane that Pikachu is under, if Pikachu is ready, then instead it will rebound the ball onto the field by using ThunderShock. Pikachu is readied by spinning a spinner on the right side of the large loop on each table. There is a gauge with a lightning bolt symbol in it to indicate how ready Pikachu is; it can only rebound the ball if this gauge is full.
