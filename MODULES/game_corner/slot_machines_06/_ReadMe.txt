Slot Machines
	This minigame operates on Coins. This version represents the slot machines from the Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald games.

There are sixteen slot machines in the Mauville Game Corner, with four of them having people already seated at them.
One to three coins can be put in the slot machine each play. One coin will only count the center row across, two coins will count all three rows across, and three coins will count all three rows across as well as both diagonals. The reels stop spinning when the player presses the A button.

Reel Time
As the player gets more triple lightning bolts, they are tallied up in the power meter at the top of the screen. At a Reel Time opportunity, an animation of a Pikachu charging up a spinner appears. When Reel Time fails (usually when there are very few lightning bolts), the spinner explodes and nothing happens. Otherwise, the spinner will stop on a number up to 5, and the player will earn that many Reel Time spins. The power meter also resets to zero.
As Reel time is so short, what happens during it is not yet precisely documented.
During Reel Time, all the reels will stop exactly where the player directs them to; unlike normal spins, the reels will not "slip" to give or take away prizes. If the player has just lost the previous spin before a Reel Time spin, the reels will also spin quite slowly (very slowly in Emerald) to allow the player to stop them precisely. If the player wins any prize, the reels speed up to normal for the next spin, which does consume one of the Reel Time spins. If the player loses, the reels slow down again. If the player creates a big bonus (three red or blue 7's, for 300 coins), Reel Time immediately ends no matter how many spins were left.
As a patron at the Game Corner notes, the maximum the player can manage to earn (through five Reel Time spins) is four regular bonuses then a big bonus, totaling 660 coins. However, since the reels speed up after a win, it may be more useful to attempt two regular bonuses and a big bonus (i.e. regular bonus, loss, regular bonus, loss, big bonus), for 480 coins.

Reels
In all versions, the reels have the following symbols. (The reels slide downward, so symbols at the bottom show up first.)
